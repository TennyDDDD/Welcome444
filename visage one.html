                                    <p>Nestled within the vibrant urban landscape of Hong Kong lies Visage One, a unique establishment that seamlessly blends the art of barber house with the soulful melodies of jazz music. Founded 21 years ago by Benky, a professional barber with a deep passion for jazz, Visage One has become a beloved destination for music enthusiasts every Saturday evening.</p>
                                    
                                    <h2><strong>"I'll wrap up the haircuts by around 5:30 pm. First, I'll tidy away all the morning hairdressing equipment, then arrange the desks and stools needed for the evening. I prefer dimming the lights and adding some candles to the shop,"</strong>  Benky explained. <strong> "Around 8 pm, musicians will arrive and set up their instruments for the performance." </strong></h2><p>he spoke, he anticipated the gradual arrival of the audience, ready to immerse themselves in the evening's musical offerings.</p>
                                    <div style="text-align: center;"  width=400>
                                        <img src="assets\images\blog\Benky.png" alt="" >
                                    </div>                                    
                                    <p>Following a week of brightly lit days at the modest barber house, spanning a mere 33 square meters, Saturday nights transform into fleeting moments akin to a jazz live scene, with candle-lit tables, chairs, and a symphony of instruments. The familiar ambiance of the barbershop evolves into a vibrant jazz venue, inviting musicians from Hong Kong and beyond to showcase their talents on its stage.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Yesterday was a remarkable evening as Scott and Eric joined forces for the first time collaboration at Visage One. Scott, a full-time saxophonist, recently released a new album, adding to his impressive musical portfolio. He had previously performed at the venue four years ago alongside another musician who has since relocated to London. Eric, a guitarist hailing from Hong Kong, has been a regular performer in the local scene and has also showcased his talents in Europe and mainland China. Meanwhile, Eric has known Benky, the owner of Visage One, for nearly eight years, highlighting the longstanding connections within the vibrant music community.</p>
                                    
                                    <h3><strong>"I composed this piece specifically for this occasion, featuring the saxophone. It's interesting, as it conveys the idea of harmony and coexistence between people or entities, sharing similar feelings and emotions，”</strong> Scott introduced one of the music they played, <strong>“ this concept is crucial in jazz music, where collaboration and mutual understanding play a significant role. Therefore, I titled the composition ‘Simpatico,’ hoping to demonstrate a harmonious collaboration between myself and Eric.”</strong></h3>
                                    
                                    <p>At the outset, the collaboration between the saxophone and guitar wasn't harmonious. The saxophone's deep and resounding tones clashed with the guitar's nimble and light melodies. After an hour of gradual fine-tuning
                                    , their collaboration reached its zenith. The initial clash between the saxophone's deep, resonant tones and the guitar's nimble, light melodies slowly evolved into a harmonious convergence. Like skilled artisans honing their craft, they delicately adjusted their sounds until they seamlessly interwoven, creating a symphony that rose to a crescendo of unity, reminiscent of the tranquil flow of mountain streams.</p>

                                    <p><strong>"Throughout that hour,"</strong> Yi Min, an audience from the live scene, remarked, <strong>"it was unmistakably clear how your collaboration underwent a graceful transformation, transitioning from initial differences to a beautifully orchestrated harmony."</strong> She found herself captivated by the performance, seeing it as a perfect illustration for the allure of jazz and the essence of Visage One, a place that embodies inclusivity and dynamism, enchanting all who step through its doors with its irresistible charm.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong>“That’s great,”</strong> Scott replied, <strong>“that’s exactly what we want.”</strong></p>
                                    
                                    <p>In the early summer of Hong Kong, yesterday's scene unfolded with a subtle promise of warmth. Mounted on the walls, several electric fans swayed rhythmically, their blades cutting through the air with a gentle hum. Their diligent motion served as a welcome respite from the encroaching heat, offering relief to the audience members as they sought solace in their cooling breeze.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Amidst the bustling ambiance of the barber house, the fans' soft whirring contributed a soothing undertone, weaving seamlessly into the fabric of the evening's atmosphere. Accompanying the free-flowing ensemble was the faint hum of the electric fans, creating a harmonious backdrop. Occasionally, the audience's adjustments in posture would produce the soft rustle of clothing or the faint creaking of chairs, stairs, and floorboards, adding to the organic symphony of sounds that filled the space.</p>
                                    <div style="text-align: center;"  width=50>
                                        <img src="assets\images\blog\visage one scene.jpg" alt="" >
                                    </div>
                                    <p>The house is ingeniously structured. Ascending a small staircase devoid of handrails leads to the second floor, where a two-meter-wide L-shaped loft awaits. This cozy loft adds to the intimacy of the venue, providing a unique space for patrons to enjoy the performances while fostering a sense of closeness and connection among performers and audience alike.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Below, spectators crowd into an array of mismatched chairs, ranging in height and style, arranged in a haphazard yet inviting manner. Some sit on the edge of the staircase, their attention focused intently on the performance unfolding on the main floor. </p>
                                    
                                    <p>Others on the second floor perch on the ground, leaning against the iron railing to peer down into the hollow space of the first floor, taking in the bustling scene below.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Even those standing by the entrance bar find themselves drawn into the charming atmosphere, becoming part of the vibrant tapestry of sights and sounds that define the essence of Visage One.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Each week's fleeting yet intimate auditory and visual feast owes its existence to Benky. Thanks to the twenty-one-year tenure of Visage One, musicians often approach him voluntarily, eager to perform. Despite being in Hong Kong, he eschews social media, relying solely on the company phone to contact musicians. Even musicians from London or New York are reached through telephone calls.</p>
